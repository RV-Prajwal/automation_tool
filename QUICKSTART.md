## Step 5: Run 24/7 (1 min)

Install PM2 (process manager):

npm install -g pm2
```

Start the automation:

```powershell
npm run pm2:start
```

Monitor the system:

```powershell
npm run pm2:monit
```

## üéØ What Happens Next?

The system will automatically:

### Daily at 2:00 AM
- Scrape Google Maps for businesses
- Filter out chains and businesses with websites
- Save qualified leads to database

### Daily at 10:00 AM
- Send personalized emails to new leads
- Send follow-ups to businesses contacted 3 and 7 days ago
- Maximum 50 emails/day (safe limit)

### Every 6 Hours
- Sync all data to Google Sheets (if configured)

### Every Hour
- Health check and log statistics

## üìä Check Your Progress

View logs:
```powershell
npm run pm2:logs
```

Check database:
```powershell
# Install SQLite viewer
npm install -g sqlite3

# View businesses
sqlite3 ./data/leads.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM businesses;"

# View qualified leads
sqlite3 ./data/leads.db "SELECT name, priority_score FROM businesses WHERE has_website=0 ORDER BY priority_score DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

## üõë Stop the System

```powershell
npm run pm2:stop
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Email Limits**: Gmail allows ~500 emails/day, we default to 50 for safety
2. **Scraping Speed**: Intentionally slow (3-7s delays) to avoid detection
3. **First Run**: May take 10-15 minutes to scrape 100 businesses
4. **Browser**: Puppeteer downloads Chromium (~170MB) on first run

## üîß Customize Settings

Edit `.env` to change:

```env
# Scrape more/less businesses per run
MAX_BUSINESSES_PER_RUN=100

# Change email limit
MAX_DAILY_EMAILS=50

# Change scraping location
GOOGLE_MAPS_LOCATION=Mumbai, India

# Change search query
GOOGLE_MAPS_SEARCH_QUERY=restaurants near me

# Change your service price
SERVICE_PRICE=15000
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module 'puppeteer'"
```powershell
npm install
```

### "Failed to launch browser"
```powershell
npx puppeteer browsers install chrome
```

### "Email authentication failed"
- Make sure 2FA is enabled on Gmail
- Use App Password, not regular password
- Remove spaces from App Password

### "Database is locked"
```powershell
npm run pm2:stop
Remove-Item data/leads.db-shm, data/leads.db-wal -ErrorAction Ignore
```

## üìà Expected Results

After 1 week of operation:
- ~700 businesses scraped (100/day)
- ~300-400 qualified leads (without websites)
- ~350 emails sent (50/day)
- ~5-10 responses (1-3% response rate)
