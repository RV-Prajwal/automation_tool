# Zone-Based Scraping Enhancement - Implementation Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All 6 phases have been successfully implemented without breaking existing functionality. The automation tool now supports **both traditional and zone-based scraping**.

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Database Schema ✓
- Added `scraped_zones` table to track geographic zones
- Enhanced `businesses` table with `zone_id` foreign key
- Maintains backward compatibility (zone_id is nullable)

### Phase 2: Zone Manager Utility ✓
- Created `src/utils/zoneManager.js`
- Generates 10x10 grid zones for Bangalore
- Tracks zone scraping status (pending → in_progress → completed)
- Provides zone statistics and coverage metrics

### Phase 3: Scraper Enhancement ✓
- Updated `src/scrapers/googleMapsScraper.js` to accept zone coordinates
- Backward compatible - works with both location strings and zone objects
- Extracts businesses with zone metadata
- Returns structured data with zone information

### Phase 4: Configuration ✓
- Added zone configuration to `src/config/config.js`
- Added environment variables to `.env`
- All settings are optional with sensible defaults

### Phase 5: Orchestration ✓
- Updated `src/index.js` scheduler
- Implements zone-based scraping when enabled
- Falls back to traditional scraping when disabled
- Smart zone cycling and reset logic

### Phase 6: Initialization Script ✓
- Created `scripts/initializeZones.js`
- One-time setup to populate zone data
- Displays coverage statistics

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Use Traditional Scraping (Default)
**No changes needed!** The tool works exactly as before.

```bash
# Just start the automation as usual
npm run pm2:start
```

### Option 2: Enable Zone-Based Scraping (New Feature)

#### Step 1: Update Database Schema
```bash
# Execute the updated schema.sql file
mysql -u root -p business_scraper < schema.sql
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Zones (One-time only)
```bash
node scripts/initializeZones.js
```

Expected output:
```
Zone Configuration:
- Grid Size: 10x10
- Total Zones: 100
- Bangalore Bounds: [...]

✓ Zone Initialization Complete
  - Zones Inserted: 100
  - Zones Skipped: 0
  - Total Zones: 100
```

#### Step 3: Enable Zone-Based Scraping
Edit `.env` file:
```env
ZONE_BASED_SCRAPING=true
```

#### Step 4: Start the Automation
```bash
npm run pm2:start
npm run pm2:logs  # Monitor progress
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Traditional Mode (ZONE_BASED_SCRAPING=false)
```
Every Scraping Job:
  └─ Search "businesses near me in Bangalore, India"
     └─ Extract all results
     └─ Same results each time (duplicates expected)
```

### Zone-Based Mode (ZONE_BASED_SCRAPING=true)
```
Every Scraping Job:
  └─ Get Next Pending Zone (e.g., Grid_0_0)
     └─ Search "businesses near me at Lat 12.85, Lon 77.50"
     └─ Extract businesses in that zone
     └─ Store with zone_id
     └─ Mark zone as completed
     
When All 100 Zones Complete:
  └─ Reset all zones to pending
  └─ Start new cycle (each zone is different now)
```

## 📊 Key Features

### ✅ No Duplicate Scraping
Each geographic area is tracked separately. Once a zone is scraped, it won't be scraped again until the complete cycle finishes.

### ✅ Full Coverage
100 zones ensure every area of Bangalore is covered systematically.

### ✅ Efficient
Smaller search radius per zone = faster results, less Google Maps throttling.

### ✅ Backward Compatible
Old scraping logic still works if zone-based scraping is disabled.

### ✅ Resumable
If the process crashes, it continues from the next pending zone automatically.

### ✅ Analytics
Dashboard shows zone coverage statistics (see API below).

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)

```env
# Enable/disable zone-based scraping
ZONE_BASED_SCRAPING=false              # Set to 'true' to enable

# Grid configuration (affects how many zones)
GRID_SIZE=10                           # 10x10 = 100 zones (adjust if needed)

# Bangalore boundaries (do not change without testing)
BOUNDS_NORTH=13.1288
BOUNDS_SOUTH=12.7383
BOUNDS_EAST=77.8221
BOUNDS_WEST=77.4564
```

## 📡 API Endpoints (Dashboard)

### Get Zone Statistics
```bash
GET /api/zone-stats

Response:
{
  "total_zones": 100,
  "pending_zones": 85,
  "in_progress_zones": 1,
  "completed_zones": 14,
  "total_businesses_found": 3421
}
```

### View All Zones
```bash
GET /api/zones

Response:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "zone_name": "Grid_0_0",
    "status": "completed",
    "business_count": 34,
    "last_scraped_at": "2025-10-29T14:30:00Z"
  },
  ...
]
```

### Reset Zones (Manual)
```bash
POST /api/reset-zones

Response:
{
  "message": "All zones reset to pending",
  "zones_reset": 14
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Verify Backward Compatibility
```bash
# With ZONE_BASED_SCRAPING=false (default)
npm run pm2:start

# Should work exactly as before
npm run pm2:logs
```

Expected: Scraping works, no zones involved.

### Test 2: Initialize Zones
```bash
node scripts/initializeZones.js
```

Expected: 100 zones created, all pending.

### Test 3: Enable Zone-Based Scraping
```bash
# Edit .env: ZONE_BASED_SCRAPING=true
npm run pm2:stop
npm run pm2:start
npm run pm2:logs
```

Expected: Scrapes one zone per job, marks it as completed.

### Test 4: Monitor Zone Progress
```bash
# Check dashboard
curl http://localhost:3000/api/zone-stats

# Should show decreasing pending_zones
```

### Test 5: Cycle Completion
```bash
# After all 100 zones are scraped
npm run pm2:logs

# Should see: "All zones completed! Resetting for next cycle..."
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Zone system not ready"
**Solution:** Run initialization script first
```bash
node scripts/initializeZones.js
```

### Issue: Database errors when running zones
**Solution:** Ensure schema.sql was executed
```bash
mysql -u root -p business_scraper < schema.sql
```

### Issue: Zone scraping is slow
**Solution:** Reduce GRID_SIZE in .env (fewer zones = faster cycles)
```env
GRID_SIZE=8    # 8x8 = 64 zones instead of 100
```

### Issue: Want to go back to traditional scraping
**Solution:** Simply disable zones in .env
```env
ZONE_BASED_SCRAPING=false
npm run pm2:restart
```

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Before (Traditional)
- Same search every time → Many duplicates
- High chance of getting throttled
- No geographic tracking
- Unpredictable results

### After (Zone-Based)
- Each area scraped systematically
- Lower throttling risk (smaller searches)
- Full Bangalore coverage in ~100 runs
- Predictable progress

---

## 🎓 Understanding the Logic

### Zone Scraping Algorithm
```javascript
1. Get next pending zone
2. If no pending zones:
   - Reset all completed zones to pending
   - Get first zone of new cycle
3. Mark zone as "in_progress"
4. Scrape that zone's area
5. Filter and process businesses
6. Mark zone as "completed" with count
7. Return to step 1
```

### Search Query Difference
```
Traditional: "businesses near me in Bangalore, India"
Zone-Based:  "businesses near me at 12.8743, 77.5821"
             (center coordinates of the zone)
```

## 🔐 Safety Guarantees

✅ **No Data Loss**: All existing businesses remain, zone_id is optional  
✅ **Reversible**: Can switch between modes anytime  
✅ **Crash-Safe**: Resumes from exact zone where it stopped  
✅ **Non-Breaking**: Old code paths still work  
✅ **Tested**: Backward compatibility maintained
