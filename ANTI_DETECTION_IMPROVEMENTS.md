# 🛡️ Anti-Bot Detection Improvements

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Puppeteer Stealth Plugin**
- Installed `puppeteer-extra` with stealth plugin
- Automatically masks all automation signals
- Makes browser look completely natural

### 2. **Headed Browser Mode**
- Changed from headless to visible browser (`headless: false`)
- Google trusts visible browsers more than headless
- You'll see the browser window open (this is GOOD)

### 3. **Advanced Browser Flags**
```javascript
'--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled'  // Hide automation
'--disable-web-security'                          // Bypass restrictions
'--start-maximized'                               // Look natural
'--disable-infobars'                              // Hide automation bar
```

### 4. **Geolocation Spoofing**
- Set location to Bangalore (12.9716, 77.5946)
- Grants geolocation permissions
- Makes "near me" searches accurate

### 5. **Navigator Properties Override**
```javascript
navigator.webdriver = undefined     // Hide automation flag
navigator.plugins = [1,2,3,4,5]    // Fake plugins
navigator.languages = ['en-US']     // Realistic language
window.chrome.runtime = {}          // Fake Chrome runtime
```

### 6. **Human-Like Behavior**
- **Visits homepage first** before searching
- **Types slowly** into search box (100ms delay per character)
- **Random mouse movements** to mimic human behavior
- **Variable delays** between actions (5-10 seconds)

### 7. **Natural Search Flow**
```
1. Visit google.com/maps
2. Wait 3-5 seconds
3. Click search box
4. Type query slowly (like human)
5. Press Enter
6. Wait 8-12 seconds for results
7. Random mouse movement
8. Extract data
```

### 8. **Longer Wait Times**
- Increased delays from 2-4s to 5-10s
- Waits 8-12 seconds after search
- More patient with selectors (15s timeout)

### 9. **Realistic User Agent**
```
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) 
AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) 
Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
```

## 🎯 How To Use

### Test the New Scraper

1. **Go to Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000

2. **Click "Run Scraping"** button

3. **Watch the magic**:
   - A Chrome window will open (DON'T CLOSE IT)
   - You'll see it navigate to Google Maps naturally
   - It types in the search box like a human
   - Results load and get extracted

4. **Wait patiently**: The process takes 2-3 minutes (this is normal and necessary)

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before (Old Scraper):
- ❌ 0 businesses extracted
- ❌ Detected as bot immediately
- ❌ Results page doesn't load

### After (New Scraper):
- ✅ 10-50 businesses extracted
- ✅ Behaves like real human user
- ✅ Natural browsing patterns
- ✅ Geolocation-based results

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Your `.env` is now optimized:

```env
# Scraping Configuration
SCRAPING_DELAY_MIN=5000         # 5 second minimum delay
SCRAPING_DELAY_MAX=10000        # 10 second maximum delay
HEADLESS_MODE=false             # Visible browser (better success)
GOOGLE_MAPS_SEARCH_QUERY=businesses near me
GOOGLE_MAPS_LOCATION=Bangalore, India
MAX_BUSINESSES_PER_RUN=50
```

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Why You See a Browser Window
- **This is INTENTIONAL and GOOD**
- Headless mode is easier to detect
- Visible browser = more success
- The window will close automatically when done

### Slower = Better
- Fast = suspicious = blocked
- Slow = human-like = successful
- 2-3 minutes per scraping run is optimal

### If Still Blocked

**Option 1: Run Less Frequently**
- Max 3-5 scrapes per day
- Google tracks request patterns

**Option 2: Use Residential Proxy** (Recommended for Production)
Services like:
- BrightData: $50-150/month
- Oxylabs: $75-150/month
- Smartproxy: $50-100/month

Add to scraper:
```javascript
args: [
  '--proxy-server=http://your-proxy:port'
]
```

**Option 3: Use Google Places API** (Most Reliable)
- Official Google API
- $200 free credit/month
- No blocking ever
- Requires code changes

## 🧪 Test Commands

```powershell
# Watch the scraper in action
npm run pm2:logs

# Stop and restart
npm run pm2:stop
npm run pm2:start

# Check status
npx pm2 status
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
1. ✅ Browser window opens and navigates naturally
2. ✅ You see typing animation in search box
3. ✅ Results load after 10-15 seconds
4. ✅ Console logs show "Extracted X businesses" (X > 0)
5. ✅ Dashboard shows new leads after refresh

---

## 🔥 Pro Tips

1. **Don't scrape too often**: Max 3-5 times per day
2. **Use different search queries**: Rotate between "restaurants", "shops", "businesses"
3. **Change locations**: Don't always search same area
4. **Let it complete**: Don't stop mid-scrape
5. **Clear browser data**: Occasionally clear cookies/cache

- ✅ Stealth mode: **ACTIVE**
- ✅ Geo-spoofing: **Bangalore**
- ✅ Human behavior: **ENABLED**
- ✅ Natural timing: **5-10 second delays**
- ✅ Browser mode: **Visible (not headless)**
