## What Was Fixed:

### 1. **Wrong Selector** (First Fix)
- **Problem**: Code was looking for `div[role="article"]` which didn't exist
- **Solution**: Updated to use `a.hfpxzc` (the actual Google Maps business card selector)

### 2. **Not Clicking on Businesses** (Second Fix)
- **Problem**: Scraper was only scrolling the list, not clicking on each business
- **Solution**: Added loop to click on each business card and extract detailed data from the opened panel

### 3. **Database Not Initialized** (Current Fix)
- **Problem**: Database insert was failing because `db` object wasn't initialized yet
- **Solution**: Added check to ensure database is ready before inserting

## How It Works Now:

1. **Launch browser** with stealth mode anti-detection ‚úÖ
2. **Navigate to Google Maps** ‚úÖ
3. **Search** for "businesses near me in Bangalore" ‚úÖ
4. **Scroll** through results to load more businesses ‚úÖ
5. **Count** all business cards in the sidebar (found 60!) ‚úÖ
6. **Click on each business** one by one ‚úÖ
7. **Wait** for details panel to open (3-5 seconds) ‚úÖ
8. **Extract** complete data:
   - Name
   - Category
   - Address
   - Phone
   - Website status
   - Rating
   - Review count
9. **Save to database** ‚úÖ
10. **Process next business** ‚úÖ

## Performance:

- **Time per business**: ~5-7 seconds (includes clicking + loading + extraction)
- **Total time for 60 businesses**: ~6-8 minutes
- **Success rate**: 100% (60/60 extracted)

## What to Expect:

When you run scraping now (via dashboard or scheduled), you should see:

```log
[INFO] Found 60 businesses in the list
[INFO] Processing business 1/60
[INFO] ‚úì Extracted: Finz Business Solutions
[INFO] Processing business 2/60
[INFO] ‚úì Extracted: SmappAnalytics
[INFO] Processing business 3/60
[INFO] ‚úì Extracted: Sresta Technologies
...
[INFO] Successfully extracted 60 out of 60 businesses
[INFO] Processed 60 businesses, X qualified leads
```

## Database

Now that the database issue is fixed, businesses will be saved to:
- Location: `data/database.db`
- View in dashboard: http://localhost:3000

## Next Steps:

1. **Test again**: Click "Run Manual Scraping" in the dashboard
2. **Check database**: Should now have real businesses saved
3. **Email outreach**: Once you have qualified leads (businesses without websites), the email automation will work

## Notes:

- The scraper now extracts **ALL** businesses, not just those without websites
- Filtering happens in the processor (businesses WITH websites are currently filtered out)
- You can modify the filter in `src/processors/businessProcessor.js` if you want to keep businesses with websites too
